# Mental Chronometry

__Mental chronometry__ is the use of response time to infer mental processes. The way for this is the manipulation of the tasks and/or of variables determining the behavior of participants in the tasks. 

Mental chronometry is one of the core paradigms of experimental and cognitive psychology. 


# Cognitive processes and processing time

* __Reaction time (RT)__, measured the elasped time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response, is an index of processing speed. 
    * Duration of sequential processes between stimulus onset and response production

* What cognitive processes do reaction time and error data represent?

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}

```

# Behavioral measures

\begincols {0.6\textwidth}

* Reaction times (RTs)
* Error rates
* Speed-accuracy trade-offs (SAT)
    * Relation between RTs and errors

# Underlying cognitive structures

\begincols {0.6\textwidth}

# Donders' subtraction idea

\begincols {0.6\textwidth}

> The idea occurred to me to _interpose into the process of the physiological time some new components of mental action_. If I investigated how much this would lengthen the physiological time, this would, I judged, reveal the time required for the interposed term.

# Pure insertion assumption

* Condition A has all the stages of condition B
* Condition B has __one less__ stage
* Duration of the extra process can be identified:

$$ RT_A - RT_B $$

# How do we 'interpose' processes?

* Use different tasks, keeping the same stimuli

    1. C1 does not take place at all
    2. C1 takes place in both cases
    3. Our test did not have enough power

# Why subtraction method fails?

\begincols {0.5\textwidth}

__Assumption__

* Pure insertion
    * insertion/removal of processing stages does not influence other processing stages
* Successive processing
    * subcomponents do not overlap and add independently to the overall RT

\colsep {0.5\textwidth}

__Criticsm__

* Külpe (1893): insertion of a new process changes of the whole task
* Cascades/overlapping processing is much more plausible processing architecture

\endcols

# Summary - subtraction method
* Subtraction method is very useful, especially for fMRI
    * fMRI subtracts __space__
    * RT subtracts __time__
    * subtraction method in fMRI does not tell much about _connectivity patterns_.
* Not a very plausible model for complexity cognitive system
    * e.g., massively parallel system

# Additive factor method (AFM)

* No pure insertion assumption
* Change in paradigm (compared to pure insertion)
    * keeping the task __same__
    * Varying task properties
* Change in questions
    * What __independent__ cognitive processes determine task performance?
* Developed by Sternberg (1969)

# Additive factor method (AFM)
* Change in paradigm

```{r, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/afm.jpg')
```

* if __two__ experimental manipulations influence __different stages__, they should produce __additive RT effects__
* if there are additive effects, there are different processing stages

# Sternberg task

* Task
    * Memory list followed by a test stimulus
    * Was the test in the memory list?

    * Test quality (degraded vs. intact)
    * Memory load (1, 2, or 4 items)

# Sternberg task

\begincols {0.5\textwidth}

* Main effect of _stimulus quality_
* Main effect of _load_
* No interaction!
* These two properties influence independent processes

# Example: AFM in cognitive neuroscience

* Cognitive and neural mechanisms of number comparison (Dehaene, 1996)
    * A number is presented on the display and subjects decide whether the number is __greater__ or __less__ than 5.

* Manipulations:
    * Input: Arabic digits / spelled numbers (4 / four)
    * Comparison: Near 5 / far from 5
    * Response: dominant / non-dominant hand

* Each manipulation produced a significant main effect
* But no interactions!

# Does AFM make sense?

\pause

* __Partially__

* No problem with 'pure insertion'
    * Manipulation of the duration of a processing stages
* Criticism of Külpe does not hold
    * Comparison between one and the same type of tasks


# Does AFM make sense?

* __Not completely__

* Still assumption of serial processing stages
* Reversed inference fallacy
    * __If p then q__: Manipulation of independent stages will produce additive results
    * But, this does not imply __if q then p__: Failing to observe significant interactions does not imply independence of stages

# Summary of AFM
* Same task, but different manipulations
* each manipulation affect processes independently
* No problem of 'pure insertion'
* Be aware of the reversed inference fallacy

# Next week "Hands-on"

* CIP room (Leopoldstr. 44)
* Import RT data from text files
* Summarize RT data
* required packages in R: __data.table__, __dplyr__ and __ggplot2__
