# Mental Chronometry

__Mental chronometry__ is the use of response time to infer mental processes. The way for this is the manipulation of the tasks and/or of variables determining the behavior of participants in the tasks. 

Mental chronometry is one of the core paradigms of experimental and cognitive psychology. 


# Cognitive processes and processing time

* __Reaction time (RT)__, measured the elasped time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response, is an index of processing speed. 
    * Duration of sequential processes between stimulus onset and response production

* What cognitive processes do reaction time and error data represent?

# Why subtraction method fails?

\begincols {0.5\textwidth}

__Assumption__

* Pure insertion
    * insertion/removal of processing stages does not influence other processing stages
* Successive processing
    * subcomponents do not overlap and add independently to the overall RT

\colsep {0.5\textwidth}

__Criticsm__

* Külpe (1893): insertion of a new process changes of the whole task
* Cascades/overlapping processing is much more plausible processing architecture

\endcols

# Summary - subtraction method
* Subtraction method is very useful, especially for fMRI
    * fMRI subtracts __space__
    * RT subtracts __time__
    * subtraction method in fMRI does not tell much about _connectivity patterns_.
* Not a very plausible model for complexity cognitive system
    * e.g., massively parallel system

# Additive factor method (AFM)

* No pure insertion assumption
* Change in paradigm (compared to pure insertion)
    * keeping the task __same__
    * Varying task properties
* Change in questions
    * What __independent__ cognitive processes determine task performance?
* Developed by Sternberg (1969)

# Additive factor method (AFM)
* Change in paradigm

```{r, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/afm.jpg')

* if __two__ experimental manipulations influence __different stages__, they should produce __additive RT effects__
* if there are additive effects, there are different processing stages

* __Partially__

* No problem with 'pure insertion'
    * Manipulation of the duration of a processing stages
* Criticism of Külpe does not hold

# Does AFM make sense?

* __Not completely__

* Still assumption of serial processing stages
* Reversed inference fallacy
    * __If p then q__: Manipulation of independent stages will produce additive results
    * But, this does not imply __if q then p__: Failing to observe significant interactions does not imply independence of stages

# Summary of AFM
* Same task, but different manipulations
* each manipulation affect processes independently
* No problem of 'pure insertion'
* Be aware of the reversed inference fallacy

# discrete sequential stages vs. Cascaded/Parallel processes

# Cascade model vs. AFM

* Simulations show that assumption of cascaded processes allows emergence of additive effects of manipulations of the same processing stage. 
* Additive effects may also result from two factors affecting the rates of two different processes
* Different interprepretation of interaction than AFM:
    * Interactions are possible if two manipulations affect different types of processes (e.g., A affects the rate of stage 1, and B impacts asymptotic component of stage 2).

    * Interaction could be related to manipulation of two processes:
        * A on rate of encoding

# Interpretation of DDM parameters

The most important part in a diffusion model analysis is determing which psychological processes are mapped by the parameters. 

\pause

* drift rate ($v$): speed of information update
    * easy task - large drift rate; difficult task - small drift rate

\pause

* Threshold separate ($a$) 
    * Amount of information for a decision: conservative - large $a$, liberal - small $a$

\pause

* Starting point ($z$): A priori biases in the decision thresholds

\pause

* Nondecision processes ($t_0$)
    * encoding process, response excusion (e.g., aging difference).

* Maintain either exposure time or error rate constant
    * Exposure time constants - using the masking paradigm
    * error rate constant - providing feedback and reward/punishment
* If RT is your main dependent variable, you should make sure the error rates are relative equal across different experimental manipulations.

* Simon effect

    * Tendency to react towards the source of the stimulation
    * Spatial mapping and response selection interference
* Dynamic vs. Static search
    * search efficiency, measured by search slope, for dynamic and static displays were similar (Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998)
    * Arguing memory has little role in visual search
